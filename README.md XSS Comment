# WP-v-Kali-
This was a XSS comment exploit attempted in 4.2 
Similar to a XSS jpg exploit I attempted, the purpose of this exploit was to trigger an "alert message"
I logged in as an admin and created a new post
Next I posted the XSS code in the comment box 
<a href='/wp-admin/' title="" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;display:block;" onmouseover=alert(1)//'>Test</a>
I posted it and viewed the post
When a user hovers over the comment, it should trigger a message stating "alert 1"
However just like my XSS jpg exploit, I was unsuccessful at triggering a response 
I believe the vulnerability has been patched
